1. A code repository is used to store programming source code and related documents. 
The two types of repositories used are local repository such as Git or Mercurial, 
and online repository Github or Bitbucket. 
The repositories use version control to document and manage changes that are made to a program. 

2. It is advantageous to use code repository as it provides efficient collaboration of work between users or workers.
This is because it allows users to work on the same program while keeping a copy of the work done and every change by each user,
meaning work does not get lost or overwritten and users could work together to decide what revisions should be made.
It is also a benefit as it allows for social coding which means a public profile could be built among other users,
this could then be used on CVâ€™s to show to potential employers to track the profile and projects worked on.
